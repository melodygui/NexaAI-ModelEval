## Suspected Triggers

### Food  & Drink
- Red wine  (definite trigger, 3/3 exposures led to migraine)  
- Aged cheese  (possible, 2/4 exposures)  
- MSG  (uncertain, 1/3 exposures)  
- Caffeine withdrawal  (definite, happens if I skip morning coffee)  
- Artificial sweeteners  (possible, especially aspartame)  
- Chocolate  (uncertain, sometimes seems fine)

### Environmental
- Bright flickering lights  (definite)
- Strong perfumes/Scents  (definite)
- Weather changes  (possible, especially dropping barometric pressure)

### Lifestyle
- Poor sleep  (definite, <6 hours often triggers)
- High stress  (definite)
- Skipped meals  (definite)
- Dehydration  (definite)
- Screen time  (definite, >4 hours without break  (possible))

## Elimination Diet Notes  (December 2023)
- Tried eliminating common triggers for 2 weeks
- Still had 1 migraine during this period
- Adding foods back one at a time
- Definite reaction to red wine on 12/18
- Possible reaction to aged cheddar on 12/22

## Caffeine Notes  (January 2024)
- Dr. Martinez suggested eliminating caffeine completely
- Tried for 1 week but had severe withdrawal headache
- Now limiting to 1 cup morning coffee before 10am
- No caffeine after 2pm seems to help sleep
- Dr. Peterson (March follow-up) said moderate caffeine is fine as long as consistent

## Stress Management  (February 2024)
- Started 10-minute daily meditation
- Taking short breaks from computer every hour
- Weekend hikes seem to help reduce frequency
- Still experimenting with what works best

## Current Prevention Strategy  (as of March 2024)
- Need to integrate Dr. Peterson' latest recommendations with what I'v learned
- Some advice seems contradictory: headache clinic said avoid all triggers absolutely, new neurologist recommendations suggest moderation approach
- Currently most successful with:
   * Consistent sleep schedule
   * Morning coffee  (same time, same amount)  
   * Regular meals  
   * Avoiding known triggers (red wine, strong scents)  
   * Daily supplements (but confused about dosage)

## Monthly Total  (to date):  $225
