Answer:

The main themes of Pride and Prejudice are:

1. **Pride vs. Humility**: The novel explores the conflict between pride and humility through characters like Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. Mr. Darcy's pride leads him to make assumptions about Elizabeth, while she is humble and tries to understand and judge him without preconceptions.

2. **Misunderstanding and Miscommunication**: Several misunderstandings arise due to miscommunication or lack of information. For example, Mr. Gardiner leaves Darcy to pursue Bingley after he learns about Elizabeth's visit, and Elizabeth does not know about Wickham's elopement with Georgiana. Misunderstandings are also evident in Bingley's criticism of Elizabeth.

3. **First Impressions and Perception**: The novel explores how first impressions can be misleading. For instance, Mrs. Gardiner finds Darcy's behavior impressive, but Elizabeth does not, as she is more perceptive of his true character.

4. **Friendship and Loyalty**: The novel highlights the importance of friendship and loyalty. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece show kindness and compassion towards Elizabeth, and their actions demonstrate the value of true friendship.

5. **Social Class and Status**: The social hierarchy in Regency England is a significant theme. Characters like Mr. Darcy and Mrs. Gardiner hold significant social status, and their interactions with those of lower status, like Elizabeth and Bingley, highlight the societal norms and prejudices of the time.

6. **Love and Marriage**: The novel deals with the themes of love and marriage, as Elizabeth and Darcy develop feelings for each other despite their initial prejudices and misunderstandings.

Through the plot, these themes are illustrated in various ways, such as through the characters' interactions, dialogue, and actions, as well as the societal expectations and norms of the time. The novel shows how these themes can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and personal growth, as well as the resolution of misunderstandings and the development of relationships. 

The plot also includes various subplots and secondary characters that contribute to the exploration of these themes, such as Wickham's elopement, the Gardiners' kindness towards Elizabeth, and the interactions between the Bennet family and their neighbors. Through the various storylines, the novel presents a rich and engaging narrative that explores the complexities of human relationships and societal norms in a way that is both entertaining and insightful. <br>

In terms of specific scenes, the novel illustrates these themes in several key moments, such as when Elizabeth and Darcy first meet, when the Gardiners send Elizabeth to Georgiana, and when Bingley and Darcy discover Wickham's elopement. These scenes demonstrate the various misunderstandings, miscommunications, and conflicts that arise due to pride, social status, and personal prejudices, and how these can be resolved through understanding, communication, and the development of relationships. The resolution of these conflicts and misunderstandings is also indicative of the novel's themes of growth, understanding, and the development of personal relationships. <br>
