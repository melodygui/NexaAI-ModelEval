Artificial intelligence is transforming the retail industry across its value chain. On the demand side, businesses are shifting from traditional in- store channels to e- commerce channels. The result is that many employees, primarily those in retail, are losing their jobs. AI-driven automation has already replaced hundreds of thousands of jobs in retail, and this trend is likely to continue as more advanced AI tools are implemented. This is because AI is more efficient at finding the right products for customers, at personalizing the shopping experience, and at processing payments than humans are. It also provides real-time inventory management and predictive analytics to help retailers better plan their business. While some retail employees have been able to upskill and adapt to the changing environment, many have found that their skills are no longer valuable in a world dominated by AI. For example, employees who were responsible for managing and maintaining retail facilities have been replaced by AI-powered robots. Furthermore, AI has enabled new business models in retail, such as subscription services and online marketplaces, which have further reduced the demand for human labor.
===
Artificial intelligence is also transforming the health care industry in the United States. AI is helping to improve patient outcomes by analyzing medical data and identifying potential health risks. This has led to more personalized treatment plans and better disease prevention. AI is also assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases and recommending treatments. Additionally, AI is being used to develop predictive models for patient outcomes, which can help healthcare providers make more informed decisions about patient care. However, the implementation of AI in healthcare also has the potential to replace human healthcare workers. For instance, AI-powered robots are being used to perform routine tasks in hospitals, such as cleaning and sterilizing equipment. AI is also enabling the development of virtual healthcare assistants and chatbots, which can handle basic patient inquiries and provide information about treatment options. While AI has the potential to greatly improve healthcare outcomes, it also raises concerns about job displacement and the need for retraining and upskilling of healthcare workers.
===
Artificial intelligence is transforming the education industry in the United States. AI is helping to personalize learning experiences for students by analyzing their strengths and weaknesses and tailoring instruction accordingly. AI is also being used to automate grading and provide real-time feedback to students. Additionally, AI is being integrated into learning management systems to create more efficient and effective online courses. While AI has the potential to greatly enhance educational outcomes, it also raises concerns about job displacement among teachers. Many teachers are concerned that AI will replace them in the classroom, as AI-powered tools and platforms can provide personalized learning experiences and automate tasks. However, AI is not expected to completely replace human educators, as it is unlikely to replicate the complex human interactions and emotional intelligence that teachers bring to the learning environment.
===
Artificial intelligence is transforming the art industry in the United States. AI is being used to generate new art pieces, analyze and critique existing art, and even create music. While AI has the potential to greatly enhance artistic expression, it also raises concerns about job displacement among artists and art professionals. Many artists are concerned that AI will replace them in the industry, as AI-powered tools and platforms can create new art pieces and provide real-time feedback. However, AI is unlikely to completely replace human artists, as it is unlikely to replicate the unique human creativity and imagination that artists bring to their work. Additionally, AI is expected to open up new opportunities for artists and art professionals to collaborate with AI systems and explore new creative possibilities.
===
Artificial intelligence is transforming the hospitality industry in the United States. AI is being used to personalize hotel experiences for guests by analyzing their preferences and behavior. AI is also being used to automate check-in processes and manage hotel operations. Additionally, AI is being integrated into loyalty programs and marketing strategies to provide more personalized and targeted offers to customers. While AI has the potential to greatly enhance hospitality experiences, it also raises concerns about job displacement among hotel staff. Many hotel employees are concerned that AI will replace them in the industry, as AI-powered tools and platforms can automate tasks and provide personalized services. However, AI is unlikely to completely replace human employees, as it is unlikely to replicate the complex human interactions and personalized care that hotel staff provide. Additionally, AI is expected to enhance the role of human employees by enabling them to focus on providing high-quality customer service.
===
Artificial intelligence is transforming the construction industry in the United States. AI is being used to automate repetitive tasks, such as bricklaying and concrete mixing, and improve project management. AI is also being used to analyze building plans and identify potential design flaws. Additionally, AI is being integrated into construction management systems to provide real-time updates and improve project efficiency. While AI has the potential to greatly enhance construction productivity, it also raises concerns about job displacement among construction workers.

1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI)  is an indispensable catalyst of societal transformation, shaping both our professional and personal landscapes. A key player in this transformation is generative AI, which has the potential to augment productivity and boost global economies. It is predicted that generative AI could add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy and significantly increase global GDP and productivity growth (McKinsey 2023, Goldman Sachs 2023). Generative AI’ s ability to generate a wide array of output forms—from text and code to images and videos—could potentially outpace human production capacity by 2030 (J. P. Morgan 2023). Particularly in marketing and sales, generative AI has the capacity to revolutionize the generation of creative content and reshape customer interactions, accounting for a substantial portion of the projected value of AI use cases (McKinsey 2023). Generative AI is already being used extensively in marketing for copywriting and creative generation. The partnership between technology titan Nvidia and the world’ s largest advertising agency, WPP, further exemplifies the transformative potential of generative AI in marketing (Ziady 2023). Given that marketing is dominant in shaping individuals’ perceptions, we believe that Generative AI can have a significant impact on shaping society. 1

2. Further, the impact of AI extends beyond commercial sectors, penetrating the realm of education. AI’ capacity to personalize learning experiences across all educational levels has been recognized (Rudra 2023). Generative AI can improve the learning process by providing tailored information, stimulating creativity, and enhancing digital skills, preparing learners for future workplace demands. In the context of digital publishing in education, generative AI’ s potential for significant cost reduction of content creation (e.g., text, image, audio, video) underscores its practical benefits (Alphonso 2023). While generative AI has numerous benefits in business and society, we must also remain aware and vigilant for potential drawbacks. Concerns arise about the technology’ potential risks, including issues related to intellectual property rights, accuracy of output, explainability of results, and potential propagation of harmful biases. Of significant concern is the potential bias embedded in generative AI models. Different from traditional AI models that are often used for classification or prediction, generative AI models are used to create new content based on patterns from the training data, making it difficult to measure the bias as there is no single “correct” output. Instead, one would need to evaluate a range of generated content for patterns that reflect bias. Moreover, new content generated by these models, such as visual content, can directly shape users’ perceptions, perpetuate harmful stereotypes, and even distort their beliefs, especially if the generated content is widely disseminated. For example, as educational tools increasingly harness generative AI, they inherently mold young minds and shape their worldview. Content tailored to student characteristics with potential bias may inadvertently propagate or solidify harmful stereotypes, shaping perceptions in ways that may be challenging to reverse. Since generative AI models are often trained on vast quantities of data collected from the internet, lack of control over the sources presents a formidable challenge in auditing and updating the training data to handle potential bias. As the training data may encompass a plethora of perspectives, cultures, and ideologies, it becomes increasingly challenging to anticipate, let alone correct, the myriad biases that could inadvertently find their way into the model. Furthermore, the situation is complicated by the proprietary nature of several major generative AI models. These models, often owned and maintained by private entities, are not publicly available for scrutiny. This lack of transparency further exacerbates the problem, as the broader academic community and society cannot easily assess or rectify biases in such closed systems. Given their increasing popularity and rapid adoption in many domains, generative AI models may inadvertently reinforce detrimental biases and stereotypes in our society, particularly in marketing and education. The current lack of well-defined regulations and policies in the domain of generative AI presents further risks, creating space for potentially harmful applications. This study investigates potential biases in three of the most popular text-to-image AI generators—Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL·E 2. These AI tools, ranging from commercial to open- source, can generate high-quality images from text prompts, a capability used by millions of users and deployed across various domains. Fig. 1 presents some examples of images generated by each model. While the prowess of these generative AI models is well-recognized across diverse domains, it is essential to examine how these models manifest biases and stereotypes within their outputs. 1

3. Analyses and Results
3.1. Gender Bias
In order to determine the gender distribution within our data, we utilized the Face++ API, one of the best face recognition APIs on the market (Eden AI 2023), to detect faces in each image and extract various features such as gender, smile, emotion, and age. Following this, we assessed the gender distribution within each image by calculating the percentage of women or men depicted

### Food  & Drink
- Red wine  (definite trigger, 3/3 exposures led to migraine)  
- Aged cheese  (possible, 2/4 exposures)  
- MSG  (uncertain, 1/3 exposures)  
- Caffeine withdrawal  (definite, happens if I skip morning coffee)  
- Artificial sweeteners  (possible, especially aspartame)  
- Chocolate  (uncertain, sometimes seems fine)

### Environmental
- Bright flickering lights  (definite)
- Strong perfumes/Scents  (definite)
- Weather changes  (possible, especially dropping barometric pressure)

### Lifestyle
- Poor sleep  (definite, <6 hours often triggers)
- High stress  (definite)
- Skipped meals  (definite)
- Dehydration  (definite)
- Screen time  (definite, >4 hours without break  (possible))

## Elimination Diet Notes  (December 2023)
- Tried eliminating common triggers for 2 weeks
- Still had 1 migraine during this period
- Adding foods back one at a time
- Definite reaction to red wine on 12/18
- Possible reaction to aged cheddar on 12/22

## Caffeine Notes  (January 2024)
- Dr. Martinez suggested eliminating caffeine completely
- Tried for 1 week but had severe withdrawal headache
- Now limiting to 1 cup morning coffee before 10am
- No caffeine after 2pm seems to help sleep
- Dr. Peterson (March follow-up) said moderate caffeine is fine as long as consistent

## Stress Management  (February 2024)
- Started 10-minute daily meditation
- Taking short breaks from computer every hour
- Weekend hikes seem to help reduce frequency
- Still experimenting with what works best

## Current Prevention Strategy  (as of March 2024)
- Need to integrate Dr. Peterson' latest recommendations with what I'v learned
- Some advice seems contradictory: headache clinic said avoid all triggers absolutely, new neurologist recommendations suggest moderation approach
- Currently most successful with:
   * Consistent sleep schedule
   * Morning coffee  (same time, same amount)  
   * Regular meals  
   * Avoiding known triggers (red wine, strong scents)  
   * Daily supplements (but confused about dosage)

## Monthly Total  (to date):  $225
