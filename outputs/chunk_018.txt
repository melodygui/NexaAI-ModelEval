A) Love and Beauty
B) Social Standing
C) Family
D) Selfishness

**Answer:** B) Social Standing

In the context of Pride and Prejudice, the main themes are Love and Beauty (A) and Social Standing (B). These are illustrated through the plot in the way the characters' social standing affects their interactions and relationships.

For example, Elizabeth Bennet's pride and prejudice are greatly influenced by the social standing of the people around her. She is raised in the middle class and her sisters are not as well educated. Therefore, when Mr. Collins, a wealthy and established gentleman, expresses his interest in marriage, it is seen as a way to secure their future financial stability. This influences Elizabeth's initial prejudice against Mr. Collins and her reluctance to accept him as a match.

Similarly, the social standing of the women at Netherfield is also a theme. Charlotte Lucas, for instance, is not from a wealthy or influential family, but she is still accepted by the Bennet family due to her family's social standing. This acceptance by the Bennets, despite Charlotte's own lower social standing, illustrates the theme of Social Standing.

The plot also explores the theme of Love and Beauty (A). Elizabeth's feelings for Mr. Darcy are initially based on her pride and prejudice, but as the story progresses, she comes to realize that Darcy is a kind and noble man beneath his initial pride. This realization is influenced by her interactions with him and other characters, highlighting the theme that love and beauty are not always apparent at first glance.

Overall, the plot of Pride and Prejudice illustrates the themes of Love and Beauty and Social Standing through the characters' interactions, relationships, and societal expectations. These themes are central to the novel's exploration of human nature and societal norms.**A) Love and Beauty**B) Social Standing**C) Family**D) Selfishness**Correct answer:** B) Social Standing**Explanation:** The main themes of Pride and Prejudice are Love and Beauty (A) and Social Standing (B).
